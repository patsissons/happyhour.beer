# Happy Hour Beer - Documentation

## Project Overview

Happy Hour Beer is a web application that helps users find happy hour venues. The application allows users to search for venues by name, location, tag, or happy hour options, and provides detailed information about each venue's happy hours.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **SvelteKit**: Chosen for its simplicity, performance, and developer experience. SvelteKit provides a great foundation for building modern web applications with minimal boilerplate.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and better developer experience.
- **DaisyUI**: Selected as the UI component library for its simplicity, flexibility, and built-in themes. DaisyUI works well with Tailwind CSS and provides a consistent design system.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling, providing utility-first CSS that works well with DaisyUI.

### Data Structure

The application uses a simple data structure defined in `src/lib/types.ts`:

- `Venue`: Represents a venue with properties like name, address, description, etc.
- `HappyHour`: Represents a happy hour period with days, times, drinks, and food.
- `HappyHourItem`: Represents an item (drink or food) with a label, price, and optional notes.

### Page Structure

1. **Home Page (`/`)**:

   - Provides a search interface for finding venues
   - Displays venue cards with basic information
   - Allows filtering by day, price range, and tags

2. **Venue Detail Page (`/venue/[slug]`)**:
   - Shows detailed information about a specific venue
   - Displays happy hour details in a tabular format
   - Provides links to maps, directions, website, etc.

### UI/UX Decisions

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Card-Based Layout**: Venues are displayed as cards, making it easy to scan and compare.
- **Image Carousel**: For venues with multiple images, a carousel is used to display them.
- **Filtering Options**: Users can filter venues by day, price range, and tags, making it easy to find relevant venues.
- **Detailed Happy Hour Information**: Happy hour details are displayed in a tabular format, making it easy to read and compare.

## Future Enhancements
